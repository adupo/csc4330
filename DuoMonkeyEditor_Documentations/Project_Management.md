1. Vision
=========
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal of our project is to develop a web-based text editor that solves a major complication with traditional pair programming, which is conquering logistical issues. The majority of developers understand the problems that arise when organizing a meeting to get together with partners. Some of these issues are finding a time and place to meet up, staying on topic, and finding a comfortable arangement for two people to use one computer. The completion of this project delivers a simple text editor that has synchronized text editing and a messaging system that allows communication between the two programmers.

2. Configuration Management
===========================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project source code and important documentations will be stored in GitHub and approved changes will be allowed to merge with the repository. GitHub will provide the necessary means to resolve conflicts should two or more changes (or uploads) interfere with each other. We expect everyone to do their delegated tasks and upload their files via a pull request in a timely manner, so the group can look over the file before the deadline arives. Github will also provide an easy route to manage documentation and code submissions.

3. Process Model
================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are multiple factors that helped us choose Extreme Programming when discussing an approriate process model for the DuoMonkeyEditor project. The strict and short deadline, as well as the need for constant communication, is a nmajor reason that extreme programming was selected as the processs model for this project. 
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that this project would meet the necessary requirements, as defined in the software requireemnts specification document, the main principles of extreme programming need to be followed. These important principles are communication, simplicity, courage, and feedback. Besides constant communication, another facet of extreme programming that is necessary to follow is pair programing. Using pair programming techniques, as well as other extreme programming practices, will allow the project to be completed in such a short timeframe and will result in the most error-free product. 


4. Deliverables
===============
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see the following links to the project deliverables (Note: The final product will be dmonstrated upon completion of the project) <br />
- Documentation: https://github.com/adupo/csc4330/tree/master/DuoMonkeyEditor_Documentations <br />
- Final Product: https://duomonkeyeditor-5e358.firebaseapp.com/# <br />


5. Potential Risks
==================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possible risks must be considered for this project are as follows:
- The website requires the user to sign-in with their Google account or GitHub, sensitive information may be leaked or stolen.
- Users may work with important data/code that has a possibility of being lost should issues arise with the appliction or server.
- Code written on the web application may have a possibility of being stolen.
- The complexity of this project may result in ajustments to meet the strict deadlines that have been set.


6. Team Members
===============
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of the project will be conducted resembling a heirarchical team style. The documentation and project management will be the responsibilty of Aaron Dupont while the code deisgn and applicaiton architect will be managed by Wilson Zhu. Both the Project Manager (Aaron Dupont) and Application Architect (Wilson Zhu) will delegate document and coding tasks to the other members throughout the duration of this project.

Please see the below hierarchy of the DuoMonkeyEditor team:<br /> <br />
<img src="https://github.com/adupo/csc4330/blob/master/DuoMonkeyEditor_Documentations/Assets/Hierarchy.png" alt="Heirarchy" margin="auto"/> <br />
Aaron Dupont: As the Project Manager, my main tasks included making everyone aware of the deadlines and overseeing communication within the group. I focused most of my attention on the documentation for this project. I formed the outline for the documents and delegated some of the work when appropriate. In addition to the above, I organized each meeting for the group and led the organizaiton of our product delivery presentation.

Wilson Zhu: As the lead software developer, my main task was developing the application as well as deploying the website. Because the project was mostly comprised of open source applications, I was tasked to figure out the inner works of the applications and modifying them to meet our project requirements. In addition to developing the application, I was set up the website which contains the application.

Blake Allen: 

Jason Lee: As a software developer, my main tasks included implimenting backend server while helping out with testing and documentations. While implimenting the server was my main task, I also spent time testing and documentation whenever I can. 

Kevin Elizabeth: As a software developer, my main tasks included working on the log in feature, some of the back end work, and creating and monitoring some test cases of different features. I divided my time between these three tasks along with helping with the documentation.

8. Meetings Summary
===================
Below is a list of meetings the group had along with a description. Please note that instead of having multiple lengthy meetings, the group chose to stay in constant communication via Facebook Messenger and SMS to communicate progress and goals.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Meeting
--------------------------------
**Attendees:** Aaron Dupont, Wilson Zhu, Blake Allen, Jason Lee, Kevin Elizabeth <br />
**Date:** September 26, 2016<br />
**Time:** 6:00 PM<br />
**Objectives:** Assign Job Duties<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this meeting is to further discuss the ideas of a text editor system and assign possible roles to complete the project. Wilson has already completed some research on this idea and has shared the idea of using an open source application called FirePad to complete the text editor portion. The team will independently research the possibilities of this application and become familiar with its code editing uses. One issue we may run into is the ability to synchronize the text between users. The team has also been tasked with finding a laptop to act as the server for the website. While everyone is looking for a spare laptop, Wilson will further research the posibilties of using a free or cheap alternative to managing our own server. <br /> 

The work will be divided as follows:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Wilson Zhu: Application Architect (Focusing on Back End)<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Blake Allen: Log In/Back End<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Aaron Dupont: Documentation/CSS Styling<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Jason Lee: Server<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kevin Elizabeth: Log In/Back End/Documentation<br /> 
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software Testing Document
------------------------------------------
**Attendees:** Aaron Dupont, Blake Allen, Jason Lee, Kevin Elizabeth<br />
**Date:** November 21, 2016<br />
**Time:** 6:00 PM<br />
**Objectives:**Develop Tests and Outcomes<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group has just now become aware during class that the testing document is due today. There was some mix up with the actual due date of the document. Wilson Zhu was not able to make this meeting on such short notice since he has already been scheduled to work. Blake, Aaron, Jason, and Kevin are meeting in Middleton to work on and finish the document before the deadline of 11:55 PM. Blake and Aaron will create the template to follow with each test case while Jason and Kevin make a list of possible test cases. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difficult part of this meeting and document was discussing all of the places that could result in a different test case/outcome. It took two hours to discuss and document all possible test cases for the application. However, the fact that the website is currently active made the process much easier. Let the meeting notes show that even though Wilson was not working on the document, he was able to answer many questions via Facebook messenger. Facebook messenger has been the groups main form of communication.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presentation Review/Final Meeting
---------------------------------------------------
**Attendees:** Aaron Dupont, Wilson Zhu, Blake Allen, Jason Lee, Kevin Elizabeth<br />
**Date:** November 28, 2016<br />
**Time:** 4:00 PM<br />
**Objectives:**Review Presentation Slides & Create Demo Video<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was called to a mandatory meeting to go over the slides of the presentation and rehearse them. Wilson and Aaron filmed the demonstration of the application and their voiceovers. Kevin helped find music to put over the demo to make the video more interesting to watch. The group first met up with Aaron and Wilson in the Coates 151 Studio Lab while Aaron edited the video for about an hour. After the video was complete, it was added to the presentation and the group went next door in the normal class room to practice. First, Aaron played the video over the projector in the class to ensure that the video and presentation would work and that there were speakers for the video. Then, everyone decided which slides they wanted and we walked through the presentation once so that everyone could practice what to say. The next two times the group practiced the presentation without interruption so that we could see exactly how long it was. Since we were satisfied with our performance, we all went home to change into business casual outfits. This will be the last meeting the group will have since the project is now concluded. Aaron will lead the group in making the final touches for the project management document, this will be done remotely.
